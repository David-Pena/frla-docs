## Current Status 👋

Hey there! This is the first version of the Firebase Rules Learning Assistant. We're just getting started, and while it's not perfect, we're excited to share it with you!

## What We're Building 🎯

Our main goal is super simple: when you get Firebase rules (like those from Bolt), you should be able to paste them here and instantly understand:
- What each part of the rule does
- How it affects your app's security
- Why certain conditions are needed

Right now, we use pattern matching to analyze rules and provide explanations. It's not perfect yet, but it's a start!

## Help Us Improve! 💡

Your feedback is incredibly valuable! If you:
- Find something confusing
- Have ideas for improvements
- Notice any bugs
- Want certain features

Please let us know! Your input will help make this tool better for everyone.

## Thank You! 🙏

Thanks for trying out the Firebase Rules Learning Assistant. Together, we can make Firebase security rules easier to understand for everyone!
